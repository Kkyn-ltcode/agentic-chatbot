You are given one or more documents. Your task is to generate **one hard question** and its answer in strict JSON format.

Requirements:
- The question must require synthesizing multiple pieces of information within the document, or linking information across 2+ sections.  
- The answer must include the original source link(s) or citation(s) already present in the document(s).  
- The `reference` field must explicitly quote or summarize the exact part(s) of the document(s) that support the answer.  
- Output strictly in JSON, nothing else.

JSON format:
{
  "question_type": "hard",
  "question": "...",
  "answer": "... (must include documentâ€™s source link)",
  "reference": "... (the exact text or summarized info from the document that supports the answer)"
}

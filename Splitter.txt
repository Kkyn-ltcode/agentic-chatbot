You are given two or more documents. Your task is to generate **one hard question** and its answer in strict JSON format.

Requirements:
- The question must require synthesizing information from AT LEAST TWO different documents.  
- The answer must combine information across documents to be correct.  
- The answer must include the original source link(s) or citation(s) already present inside the documents.  
- The `reference` field must explicitly quote or summarize the exact parts of EACH document that were used to answer.  
- Output strictly in JSON, nothing else.

JSON format:
{
  "question_type": "hard",
  "question": "...",
  "answer": "... (must include documentsâ€™ source links)",
  "reference": {
      "document_1": "... (the exact text or summarized info from document 1 that supports the answer)",
      "document_2": "... (the exact text or summarized info from document 2 that supports the answer)",
      "...": "..."
  }
}

Documents:
<<<DOCUMENT 1 TEXT HERE>>>

<<<DOCUMENT 2 TEXT HERE>>>

(you may include more documents if needed)

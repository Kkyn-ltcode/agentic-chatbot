you are an expert at AI, graph and deep learning engineer, here are my task: Given a dataset which is network flow dataset has 16.94 mil row and 45 columns, your task is to predict flowâ€™s label. There are 2 types of label in this, 1 is binary, 2 is multi  which might be one of 10 classes (Normal and 9 different types of network attack).
My goal is to create line graph from it, which is each node is a flow and have node features, i still not sure how to build edge, but  I think we should start with how to handle this data. Here are the analyze report of my data, here are not timestamp for each flow, right now im thinking of building line graph which is: each flow will be a node, and edge (connection) i still dont know which to create but i think multi edge type will be great. Just tell me any architecture you could think of, ok, no code yet, just thinking and analyzing carefully

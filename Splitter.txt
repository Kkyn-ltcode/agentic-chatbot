You are given a document. Your task is to generate **two medium-difficulty questions** and their answers in strict JSON format.

Requirements:
- Each question must require combining or slightly interpreting information from the document (not a direct copy-paste fact).  
- The answer must include the original source link(s) or citation(s) already present in the document.  
- The `reference` field must explicitly quote or summarize the part(s) of the document that support the answer.  
- Output strictly in JSON, as a list of two objects.

JSON format:
[
  {
    "question_type": "medium",
    "question": "...",
    "answer": "... (must include document’s source link)",
    "reference": "... (the exact text or summarized info from the document that supports the answer)"
  },
  {
    "question_type": "medium",
    "question": "...",
    "answer": "... (must include document’s source link)",
    "reference": "... (the exact text or summarized info from the document that supports the answer)"
  }
]

Option 2: Using apt-get (If sudo and system-wide installation is preferred/possible)

If your Kubeflow environment allows sudo apt-get for system-wide installations, this can be simpler.

Remove existing Node.js (optional but recommended to avoid conflicts):

Bash
sudo apt-get remove nodejs npm
Add NodeSource PPA for Node.js 18:
This repository provides more up-to-date Node.js packages.

Bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
Install Node.js and npm:

Bash
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
Verify New Versions:

Bash
node -v
npm -v
You should see v18.x.x for Node and a compatible npm version.

Step 3: Reinstall Project Dependencies and Build

After successfully updating Node.js and npm using either Option 1 or Option 2:

Navigate to your project directory:

Bash
cd ~/my-chatbot-ui # Adjust path if your project is elsewhere
Clean and reinstall dependencies (CRITICAL after Node.js update):
This step is vital because node_modules often contains native binaries compiled for a specific Node.js version.

Bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
Build Your React Application:
Now that your Node.js environment is compatible and dependencies are fresh, try building again.

Bash
npx react-scripts build
This should now successfully build your React application. If you encounter any new errors, please share them, but updating Node.js is the most critical step here.
